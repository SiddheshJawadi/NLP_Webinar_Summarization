Daisy from New Zealand and Herman from Argentina are two people who decided to follow their childhood dreams.
In this program, we'll be hearing how Daisy and Herman made their dreams come true not by changing the world, but by changing themselves.
But not following them can leave you regretting all the things you wanted to do but didn't.
B I wish I had followed my dreams or C I wish I'd made more money?
Well, I'll guess it's B they wish they had followed their dreams.
Here she explains her belief in sharing to BBC World Service program, the documentary what I think I always believed in is that the sharing of resources can provide a group of people with quite a great advantage.
But Daisy says that local people struggle with the idea that everything is shared.
Daisy also says some local people call Riverside outlandish strange and unusual.
On the way here, Herman Zapp explains to BBC World Services the documentary how following his dream has changed him for the better.
I am so happy with the Herman there is now that I know now, not the one who wanted to conquer the world, but the one who was conquered by the war.
After many years traveling, meeting new people and hearing their stories, herman is more humble, not proud or arrogant.
Daisy and Herman are rare examples of dreamers who followed their dream and found a happy life lived without regret.
Not having the courage to follow your dreams was listed as the top life regret.
At least we have people like Daisy and Herman to remind us dreams can come true.

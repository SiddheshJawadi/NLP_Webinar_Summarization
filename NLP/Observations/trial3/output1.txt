The English language kitchen your recipe for success. Welcome to Two Minute English Listening, a series of free videos from the English language kitchen. You are going to hear a short excerpt, and then you will need to answer three questions. Hi, Mark. How school going? Hi, Alice. It's okay. I have so many assignments, though, and I'm worried about my exams. I'm sure you'll be fine. Which subjects are you studying? English, geography, science. Oh, I love science. Don't you love doing experiments in class? Well, yes and no. I like the experiments, but the homework we get after is always so difficult. I agree. Sometimes there's so much homework, I feel like I can't keep on top of it, especially in literature. That's my worst subject, and I think I'm falling behind my class. I think everyone finds literature difficult. You'll probably still get a good score. You're really good with words. Thanks. I hope so. Question one what subject does Alice like? Question two what does Mark like about science? Question three what is Alice's worst subject? Do you think you know the answers? If not, try listening again.

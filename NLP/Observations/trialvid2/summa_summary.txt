If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.
If you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day.
Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter.
And if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made, that you made, and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.
Every morning in Seal training, my instructors, who at the time were all Vietnam veterans, would show up in my barracks room, and the first thing they'd do was inspect my bed.
It was a simple task, mundane at best, but every morning, we were required to make our bed to perfection.
That seemed a little ridiculous at the time, particularly in light of the fact that we were aspiring to be real warriors, tough, battle hardened Seals.
Our struggles in this world are similar, and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward, changing ourselves and changing the world around us will apply equally to all.
But changing the world can happen anywhere, and anyone can do it.
So what starts here can indeed change the world.
If you want to change the world, you must be your very best in the darkest moments.
If I have learned anything in my time traveling the world, it is the power of hope.
One person can change the world by giving people hope.
Start each day with a task completed.
If you do these things, the next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today.
And what started here will indeed have changed the world for the better.
All you have to do to quit is ring the bell.
Ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at 05:00.
Ring the bell and you no longer have to be in the freezing cold swims.
Ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs, the obstacle course, the PT.
All you have to do is ring the bell to get out.
If you want to change the world, don't ever, ever ring the bell.
